AS A RESULT, ATMOS REOPENED THE INVESTIGATION TO DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF THE FAILURE OF THE POLY PIPE.    THE ANALYSIS OF THE PIPE REVEALED THAT THE FUSION PERFORMED AND HELD PRESSURE FOR 29 YEARS WITHOUT ANY REPORTED LEAKS.  THE LABORATORY EXAMINATION OF THE PIPE INDICATED THAT THE OUTWARD APPEARANCE OF THE PIPE SATISFIED STANDARDS AND PRACTICES FOR THE SIZE OF THE BEAD AS AN INDICATOR OF THE COMPLETENESS OF THE FUSION.

THE CALLER REPORTED A STRONG ODOR OF GAS, PARTICULARLY IN THE BASEMENT OF THE BUILDING.  A MICHCON TECHNICIAN WAS DISPATCHED TO THE ADDRESS AT 14:59, AND ARRIVED AT 15:21.  A SECOND GAS LEAK REPORT WAS RECEIVED AT 15:04 FOR THE SAME BUILDING; THIS CALLER ALSO REPORTED A STRONG GAS ODOR IN THE BASEMENT BUT ALSO AN ODOR OF GAS IN HIS BUSINESS ON THE SECOND FLOOR.      UPON ARRIVAL, THE MICHCON TECHNICIAN ENTERED THE FIRST FLOOR OF THE BUILDING AND BEGAN CHECKING FOR THE PRESENCE OF COMBUSTIBLE GAS.  FINDING NO COMBUSTIBLE GAS READINGS ON THE FIRST FLOOR, THE TECHNICIAN CHECKED AROUND THE DOORWAY LEADING TO THE BASEMENT OF THE BUILDING TO CONTINUE HIS INVESTIGATION IN THE BASEMENT WHERE THE ODOR INTENSITY HAD BEEN REPORTED AS BEING STRONGEST.  THE BASEMENT DOOR AT THE TOP OF THE FIRST FLOOR STAIRWELL WAS CLOSED, AND THE TECHNICIAN CHECKED FOR THE PRESENCE OF COMBUSTIBLE GAS AROUND THE FRAME AND AT THE BASE OF THE CLOSED DOOR.  FINDING NO INDICATIONS OF COMBUSTIBLE GAS, THE TECHNICIAN OPENED THE DOOR AND IMMEDIATELY HIS GAS DETECTOR REGISTERED A READING OF 4% GAS CONCENTRATION AND RISING.  WHILE TURNING TO EXIT THE BUILDING, THE TECHNICIAN WAS STRUCK BY A RUSH OF HEATED GASES AND DEBRIS.  AN EXPLOSION LEVELED THE TWO-STORY STRUCTURE, DAMAGING NEARBY BUILDINGS AND STREWING DEBRIS ACROSS THE INTERSECTION OF WEALTHY AND ETHEL.  A REPORT WAS RECEIVED FROM THE GRAND RAPIDS FIRE DEPARTMENT AT 15:40 ADVISING MICHCON THAT AN EXPLOSION HAD OCCURRED ON WEALTHY STREET, BUT THAT THEY HAD NO ADDRESS.    MICHCON CREWS BEGAN ARRIVING ON THE SCENE AT 15:48.  COMBUSTIBLE GAS READINGS WERE FOUND IN SEVERAL ADJACENT BUILDINGS AND IN SOME OF THE SEWER LINES IN WEALTHY STREET EAST AND WEST OF ETHEL.  HIGHEST CONCENTRATIONS OF COMBUSTIBLE GAS WERE FOUND NEAR THE PARKING AREA ALONG THE EAST SIDE OF THE BUILDING AND ALONG THE WALLS OF THE BUILDINGS ON THE NORTH SIDE OF WEALTHY STREET, ACROSS FROM 1500-1502 WEALTHY.  MICHCON FOUND A CIRCUMFERENTIAL BREAK WITH APPROXIMATELY 1/4-INCH OF SEPARATION BETWEEN THE PIPE ENDS ON A 6” CAST IRON MAIN IN WEALTHY STREET, WHICH WAS SUCCESSFULLY REPAIRED AT 21:14 USING A BOLT-ON STAINLESS STEEL CLAMP.  AT 23:30, MICHCON SHUT DOWN THE MAINS IN THE INTERSECTION AS A PRECAUTIONARY MEASURE.  THE 1-INCH COPPER SERVICE LINE TO 1500-1502 WEALTHY WAS DISCONNECTED FROM THE MAIN AT 23:36, BUT DUE TO CONTINUING FIREFIGHTING ACTIVITIES AND THE SUBSTANTIAL DEBRIS MICHCON WAS UNABLE TO LEAK TEST OR  RECOVER THE REMNANTS OF THE SERVICE LINE AT THAT TIME.    MICHCON GAVE TELEPHONIC NOTICE TO THE MICHIGAN PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION IN LANSING AT 16:31 AND TO THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER AT 16:44.     FIVE PEOPLE, INCLUDING FOUR BUILDING OCCUPANTS AND MICHCON’S TECHNICIAN, WERE TRANSPORTED TO LOCAL HOSPITALS.  MICHCON’S SERVICE TECHNICIAN WAS ADMITTED AND THE REST WERE RELEASED LATER THAT DAY.    MICHCON PERFORMED A SUCCESSFUL LEAK TEST OF THE SERVICE LINE AT NORMAL 2 PSIG OPERATING PRESSURE ON MARCH 20, 2008, INCLUDING APPROXIMATELY 20 FEET OF 1-INCH COPPER PIPE BETWEEN THE MAIN AND THE BUILDING, 2 FEET OF 1-INCH COATED STEEL PIPE WHICH SERVED AS THE BUILDING ENTRANCE, AND A 1-INCH COUPLING OUTSIDE THE BUILDING WALL CONNECTING THE TWO PIPING MATERIALS.  NO LEAKAGE WAS FOUND ON THE SERVICE LINE.    THE CAUSE OF THE EXPLOSION AND THE SOURCE OF THE GAS HAVE NEVER BEEN DETERMINED.  ON MARCH 20, 2008, A SEGMENT OF THE BROKEN 6-INCH CAST IRON MAIN FOUND ON FEBRUARY 26, 2008, INCLUDING THE CIRCUMFERENTIAL FRACTURE SEALED BY THE STAINLESS STEEL CLAMP, WAS CUT AND REMOVED FROM WEALTHY STREET.  LABORATORY EXAMINATION OF THE 6-INCH PIPE REMOVED FROM THE MAIN IN FRONT OF 1500-1502 WEALTHY STREET SE REVEALED IT TO BE GREY CAST IRON WITH A COMPLETE CIRCUMFERENTIAL CRACK, THE RESULT OF A SINGLE OVERLOAD EVENT.  THE FRACTURE FACES EXHIBITED GRAPHITIC CORROSION AT SEVERAL LOCATIONS UP TO DEPTHS OF 70 TO 80 PERCENT OF THE PIPE WALL THICKNESS.  THE REMAINING WALL THICKNESS WAS SUFFICIENT TO MAINTAIN THE INTEGRITY OF THE PIPE UNDER NORMAL OPERATING CONDITIONS.  THE CONDITION OF THE FRACTURE FACES RULED OUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE BREAK OCCURRED WEEKS OR MONTHS PRIOR TO THE EXPLOSION AT 1500-1502 WEALTHY, BUT METALLURGICAL TESTING WAS UNABLE TO ESTABLISH WHETHER THE BREAK RESULTED FROM THE FORCE OF THE EXPLOSION OR IF IT OCCURRED JUST PRIOR TO THE EXPLOSION.  BOTH POSSIBILITIES WERE DETERMINED TO BE EQUALLY LIKELY.    MICHCON AND SEVERAL OTHER INVESTIGATORY ENTITIES, INCLUDING FIRE OFFICIALS, INSURANCE ADJUSTERS, AND FAILURE ANALYSTS, WERE UNABLE TO EVALUATE THE POSSIBILITY THAT NATURAL GAS HAD LEAKED FROM FUEL PIPING INSIDE THE BUILDING AT 1500-1502 WEALTHY.  DEBRIS FROM THE EXPLOSION WAS PUSHED FROM THE SURROUNDING STREETS AND ALLEYS BACK INTO THE BASEMENT WITHIN HOURS OF THE EXPLOSION, DAMAGING OR DESTROYING THE BUILDING FUEL PIPING IN THE PROCESS.  NONE OF THIS PIPING COULD BE EXAMINED TO DETERMINE IF IT COULD HAVE BEEN A POSSIBLE SOURCE OF A GAS LEAK INTO THE BASEMENT OF THE BUILDING, NOR COULD AN IGNITION SOURCE BE DETERMINED.  HOWEVER, ANALYSIS DID CONFIRM THAT A RELATIVELY MINOR LEAK FROM THE CUSTOMER FUEL PIPING INSIDE THE BUILDING COULD HAVE PRODUCED AN EXPLOSIVE ENVIRONMENT IN THE BASEMENT WITHIN HOURS.    MICHCON WAS NOT ABLE TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE FRACTURE OF THE 6-INCH CAST IRON PIPE OCCURRED PRIOR TO OR AS A RESULT OF THE EXPLOSION AT 1500-1502 WEALTHY STREET SE ON FEBRUARY 26, 2008.  THEREFORE, MICHCON CANNOT DETERMINE WHETHER THE EXPLOSION WAS CAUSED BY NATURAL GAS LEAKING FROM THE CAST IRON MAIN OR, AS HAS BEEN SUGGESTED BY SOME FIRE AND EXPLOSION INVESTIGATORS, THE EXPLOSION RESULTED FROM THE IGNITION OF NATURAL GAS LEAKING FROM A CUSTOMER’S FUEL LINE INSIDE THE BUILDING.  BOTH POTENTIAL CAUSES WERE DEEMED POSSIBLE; NEITHER COULD BE ELIMINATED.  THE CAUSE OF THIS INCIDENT HAS BEEN CLASSIFIED AS “UNKNOWN.”"},

FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 8, 2008    INVESTIGATION     PGW ON SCENE DURING THE FIRE MARSHALL (FM) INVESTIGATION OF THE EXPLOSION/FIRE AT 709 S. 6TH STREET.  FIRE MARSHALL CLAY WAS THE LEAD INVESTIGATOR IN CHARGE.  PUC SAFETY DIVISION WAS REPRESENTED BY PAUL METRO, PETE STANLEY AND MICHAEL NYGUEN.     AFTER DEBRIS AND UNSAFE OVERHANGING STRUCTURES WERE REMOVED IN FRONT OF THE PROPERTY, PGW CONTINUED TO ASSIST THE FM BY PREPARING AND TESTING THE MAIN AND SERVICES ABANDONED THE PREVIOUS NIGHT.  A 6¿ WATER COLUMN PRESSURE TEST (OPERATING PRESSURE AT THE TIME) WAS PLACED ON THE MAIN AND SERVICES.  THIS TEST FAILED.  WHEN DEBRIS WAS REMOVED IN FRONT OF 709 S. 6TH STREET, PGW PROVIDED BARHOLES FOR LEAK INVESTIGATION.  HIGHEST READING FOUND WAS A 3% GAS READING IN A BARHOLE.  THIS WAS ASSUMED TO BE RESIDUAL GAS FROM THE DISCONTINUED MAIN.     SINCE THE MAIN AND SERVICES FAILED TEST, THE NEXT STEP OF THE INVESTIGATION WAS TO DISCONNECT THE SERVICES AND TEST THEM INDIVIDUALLY. THEY ALL PASSED AN AIR TEST.  THE MAIN WAS THEN TESTED AND THIS TEST FAILED.    THE FIRE MARSHALL CONCLUDED THE INVESTIGATION AND SCHEDULED CONTINUATION THE FOLLOWING DAY.      SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 9, 2008    INVESTIGATION    STEVEN GROEBER, DIRECTOR, FIELD OPERATIONS REPRESENTING PGW, FIELD MARSHALL CLAY, PETE STANLEY AND MICHAEL NYGUEN WERE ON LOCATION SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 9, 2008 AT 0700.

THE FAILURE/RELEASE WAS AN ACETYLENE GIRTH WELD THAT SPLIT OPEN ON THE WESTSIDE OF THE PIPELINE. THE WELD WAS NEXT TO A PERPENDICULAR TRENCH THAT WAS DUG TO INSTALL A WATER LINE, WHICH PASSED UNDER THIS PIPELINE. THERE WAS A RETAINING WALL THAT WAS BUILT APPROXIMATELY SIX FEET TALL PARALLEL TO THIS PIPELINE. ALL THIS CONSTRUCTION TOOK PLACE IN THE SUMMER OF 2007. THE DAY OF FAILURE WAS WARM 45 DEGREES. THE WEATHER PRIOR TO THIS WAS COLD WITH SOME DAYS BELOW ZERO. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF FORCES THAT ARE BEING INVESTIGATED TO DETERMINE THE REASON FOR FAILURE. THE WELD WAS REPAIRED BY SHUTTING IN THE EFFECTED LINE SECTION AND A NEW SECTION OF PIPE WAS INSTALLED. THE RESULT OF SHUTTING IN THIS LINE SECTION CAUSED APPROXIMATELY 5200 CUSTOMERS TO HAVE THEIR GAS SERVICE INTERRUPTED. THE WELD IS BEING SENT TO STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY FOR FAILURE TESTING.

CHARLES MOORE WAS THE OWNER/OPERATOR OF THE BACK-HOE.  MR. GRIGSBY ASKED MR. MOORE IF HE WOULD DIG THE WATERLINE UP SO HE COULD MAKE THE NECESSARY REPAIRS.  MR. MOORE SAID YES AND DROVE THE BACK-HOE TO THE JOB SITE.    AS MR. MOORE WAS DIGGING, THE BUCKET OF THE BACK-HOE STRUCK AND PULLED IN TWO, THE NATURAL GAS SERVICE FEEDING 8016 MAIN STREET.  MR. GRIGSBY STATED THAT AT THAT TIME HE CALLED TO AN OFFICE IN TOWN AND ASKED WHAT THE NUMBER FOR LG&E WAS.  MR. GRIGSBY STATED THAT ONCE HE RECEIVED THE NUMBER HE CALLED LG&E TO REPORT THE DIG-IN.    MR. GRIGSBY AND MR. MOORE BOTH STATED THAT THEY COULD SMELL A SLIGHT ODOR OF NATURAL GAS BUT, COULD NOT HEAR IT BLOWING.  MR. MOORE STATED THAT WHEN HE STRUCK THE NATURAL GAS SERVICE HE STOPPED DIGGING AND SHUT THE BACK-HOE OFF AND LEFT IT IN PLACE.  HE ALSO STATED THAT AFTER THE DIG-IN, HE RETURNED TO A SHOP DOWN THE STREET.  MR. GRIGSBY STATED THAT AFTER THE DIG-IN, HE RETURNED TO A SECOND HOLE THAT HE HAD ALREADY DUG.    MR. GRIGSBY STATED THAT HE WAS ATTEMPTING TO INSTALL A WATER VALVE ON A CHURCH¿S WATERLINE IN THE SECOND HOLE, WHEN THE EXPLOSION OCCURRED DESTROYING THE CHURCH.  THERE WERE NO INJURIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE EXPLOSION.    THE HENRY COUNTY 911 DISPATCH RECEIVED A CALL REPORTING THE EXPLOSION AT 2:37PM.  THE CAMPBELLSBURG FIRE AND RESCUE WAS DISPATCHED AT 2:38PM.

THE CREW THEN SHUT THE NATURAL GAS SERVICE OFF TO THE CHURCH AND THE HOUSE NEXT DOOR.    THE PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATIONS DID POINT TO NATURAL GAS AS THE CAUSE OF THE EXPLOSION.  A JOINT INVESTIGATION WAS HELD THE NEXT DAY, APRIL 20, 2006 WITH LG&E, INDIANA INSURANCE COMPANY, THE KENTUCKY STATE POLICE, THE KENTUCKY STATE FIRE MARSHALL¿S OFFICE AND FEDERAL ALCOHOL TOBACCO AND FIREARMS.  INVESTIGATORS FROM THE KENTUCKY PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION WERE ALSO ON SCENE.    THE JOINT INVESTIGATION FOUND THAT THE NATURAL HAS SERVICE GOING TO 8016 MAIN STREET HAD BEEN RE-LINED AND WAS ½ INCH PLASTIC SERVICE INSIDE OF A 1 ¼ INCH BARE STEEL LINE.  INVESTIGATION FOUND THAT THE PLASTIC SERVICE HAD BEEN PULLED IN TWO BY THE BACK-HOE.  THERE WAS A 6 INCH TERRACOTTA TILE DRAIN PIPE RUNNING FROM THE CHURCH TO THE MAIN SEWER LINE THAT RAN PERPENDICULAR TO THE NATURAL GAS SERVICE.  NEAR THE POINT WHERE THE NATURAL GAS SERVICE WAS PULLED APART, THE DRAIN PIPE WAS ALSO CRACKED.  THE INVESTIGATION FOUND THAT THERE WERE TREE ROOTS ON, AROUND AND INSIDE OF THE DRAIN PIPE.    THE DRAIN PIPE HAD SEVERAL CRACKS AND AN APPROXIMATELY 1 INCH HOLE ON THE BOTTOM OF THE DRAIN PIPE.  THE END OF THE PLASTIC NATURAL GAS SERVICE WAS 14 INCHES AWAY FROM THE DAMAGED SECTION OF THE DRAINPIPE AND WAS NEARLY IN-LINE WITH THE DAMAGED AREA AND HOLE.  THE ESCAPING 30PSI NATURAL GAS WAS BLOWING INTO THE DRAINPIPE AND FILLING THE CHURCH¿S BASEMENT WITH NATURAL GAS.  THERE WERE TWO FURNACES LOCATED IN THE BASEMENT THAT WERE PILOT LIGHT OPERATED.  ONCE THE NATURAL GAS FILLED THE BASEMENT AREA IT REACHED THE PILOT LIGHTS AND IGNITED.  THIS WAS A HIGH ORDINANCE EXPLOSION.    THE INVESTIGATION FOUND THAT MR. MOORE HAD NOT CONTACTED THE KENTUCKY ONE CALL CENTER FOR A BUD REQUEST LOCATED OF THE UTILITIES IN THE AREA.

THE AMERENUE CONTRACTOR COMPLETED THE FIRST PHASE OF THE PROJECT BY REPLACING THE EXISTING CAST IRON MAINS AND STEEL SERVICES. THE SECOND PHASE OF THE PROJECT INVOLVED CONVERTING A LOW PRESSURE AREA WHICH HAD EXISTING POLYETHYLENE MAINS AND SERVICES TO 10 PSIG. THE EXISTING POLYETHYLENE MAINS AND SERVICES HAD AN ESTABLISHED MAOP OF 60 PSIG. THIS REQUIRED SEPARATING A SECTION OF THE EXISTING POLYETHYLENE MAINS FROM THE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM, ADDING REGULATORS TO EACH METER IN THE SECTION, AND CONNECTING THE SECTION TO AN ADJACENT 10 PSIG GAS SOURCE. THE SECTION TO BE CONVERTED WAS SIZED TO ALLOW FOR THE COMPLETION OF WORK BY THE AMERENUE CONTRACTOR WITHIN A SINGLE DAY TO MINIMIZE GAS SERVICE INTERRUPTION.       INCIDENT INFORMATION: THE CONTRACTOR BEGAN THE MORNING BY PERFORMING WORK TO ISOLATE THE SYSTEM TO BE CONVERTED TO 10 PSIG FROM THE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM. DURING THIS TIME ADDITIONAL CONTRACTOR CREW MEMBERS WENT TO EACH OF THE THIRTEEN METER LOCATIONS DESIGNATED BY AMERENUE AS PART OF CONVERSION TO SHUT OFF SERVICE AND TO REMOVE THE METER FROM THE INLET PIPING. AN AMERENUE INSPECTOR WAS WITNESSING THIS ACTIVITY AND CHECKED EACH SERVICE OFF OF A LIST ONCE THE WORK WAS COMPLETED.     THE CONTRACTOR COMPLETED THE WORK TO ISOLATE THE SYSTEM AT APPROXIMATELY 11:00 AM. THE AMERENUE SUPERVISOR, AMERENUE INSPECTOR, AND THE CONTRACTOR FOREMAN MET AGAIN AT APPROXIMATELY 11:30AM TO REVIEW THE WORK COMPLETED TO THIS POINT AND TO REVIEW THE PLANS TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING WAS READY FOR THE INTRODUCTION OF 10 PSIG INTO THE SYSTEM. THEY REVIEWED THE CONSTRUCTION PRINTS AND DISCUSSED THE MAIN SEPARATION LOCATIONS, TIE-IN LOCATIONS, AND THE THIRTEEN SERVICE LOCATIONS THAT WERE SEPARATED. ALL WERE IN AGREEMENT THAT THEY WERE READY TO PROCEED WITH THE NEXT STEP OF INTRODUCING 10 PSIG INTO THE SYSTEM.      AT APPROXIMATELY 11:35 AM, A VALVE WAS OPENED TO INTRODUCE THE 10 PSIG INTO THE SYSTEM. AT APPROXIMATELY 11:53 AM, THE AMERENUE SUPERVISOR OVERHEARD THE AMERENUE DISPATCHER CALLING AN AMERENUE SERVICEMAN TO RESPOND TO A GAS PRESSURE PROBLEM AT A RESTAURANT AT 415 ASHLEY ROAD IN BOONVILLE. THE   AMERENUE SUPERVISOR RECOGNIZED THE RESTAURANT WAS LOCATED ON THE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM JUST NORTH OF THE AREA THAT WAS BEING CONVERTED TO 10 PSIG. HE SUSPECTED THERE MUST BE A PROBLEM RESULTING FROM THE SYSTEM CONVERSION SO HE CALLED THE AMERENUE INSPECTOR AND INSTRUCTED HIM TO CLOSE THE VALVE THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY OPENED. THE INSPECTOR HAD LEFT THE JOB SITE TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL MATERIALS SO HE CONTACTED THE CONTRACTOR BY CELL PHONE AND INSTRUCTED TO IMMEDIATELY CLOSE THE VALVE. THE AMERENUE SUPERVISOR RETURNED TO THE JOB SITE AND INSTRUCTED THE CONTRACTOR TO OPEN METER SERVICE VALVES IN THE AREA AND CUT A CAP OFF OF AN EXPOSED POLYETHYLENE MAIN TO RELIEVE THE 10 PSIG OF PRESSURE FROM THE SYSTEM.        THE AMERENUE SUPERVISOR CONTACTED THE AMERENUE SUPERINTENDENT, ENGINEERING AND OPERATIONS AND NOTIFIED HIM OF THE SITUATION AT APPROXIMATELY 12:10 PM.  THE SUPERINTENDENT INSTRUCTED AMERENUE SUPERVISOR TO SEND AMERENUE GAS PERSONNEL TO THE LOW PRESSURE REGULATOR STATIONS TO BLEED THE PRESSURE OFF OF THE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM THAT WAS AFFECTED. IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WAS PRESSURIZED TO 10 PSIG SO THE SUPERINTENDENT INSTRUCTED THE SUPERVISOR TO SHUT DOWN AND ISOLATE THE ENTIRE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM.      THE SUPERINTENDENT ARRIVED AT BOONVILLE AT APPROXIMATELY 12:50PM. AT THAT TIME THE AFFECTED LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WAS DEPRESSURIZING AND WAS AT A PRESSURE OF 0-1 PSIG.     AT APPROXIMATELY 1:30 PM AMERENUE GAS PERSONNEL BEGAN SHUTTING OFF THE METERS THAT SERVED THE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM THAT WAS ISOLATED. ADDITIONAL A MERENUE GAS PERSONNEL FROM OTHER LOCATIONS WERE CALLED TO ASSIST. THERE WERE APPROXIMATELY 750 CUSTOMERS AFFECTED BY ISOLATING THE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM.     AMERENUE INVESTIGATED AND DISCUSSED THE SITUATION TO DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF THE OVER PRESSURIZATION. IT WAS IDENTIFIED THAT A 4¿ MAIN CONNECTING THE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM AND THE SYSTEM TO BE CONVERTED TO 10 PSIG WAS OVERLOOKED AND WAS NOT SEPARATED PRIOR TO INTRODUCING THE 10 PSIG. THIS ALLOWED THE 10 PSIG TO FLOW INTO THE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM, WHICH IS SUPPLIED BY REGULATOR STATIONS THAT ARE IN A MONITOR CONFIGURATION, CAUSING THE SYSTEM OVER PRESSURIZATION."},

AT APPROXIMATELY 1:50PM MDST THE HOME EXPLODED FROM WHAT APPEARS INITIALLY A BUILD UP OF GAS IN THE CRAWL SPACE OF THE NEW ADDITION.  THE GAS MIGRATED TO AN IGNITION SOURCE, MOST LIKELY THE HOT WATER HEATER OR FURNACE AND EXPLODED.  COLORADO NATURAL GAS EMPLOYEES REPONDED AT 2:11PM TO A ELK CREEK FIRE DEPARTMENT REQUEST.  THE HOME WAS ON FIRE AT THE SOUTH END.  THE END OPPOSITE OF THE NATURAL GAS METER AND SERVICE LINE.  ELK CREED FIRE DEPARTMENT HAD THE FIRE EXTINGUISHED BY THE TIME COLORADO NATURAL GAS EMPLYEES ARRIVED AT 2:18PM.  THE STRUCTURE WAS STILL UPRIGHT HOWEVER THE NEW ADDITION WAS SEPERATED FROM THE OLDER EXISTING HOME BY 2 FEET 4 INCHES.
